# dynamic_programming
Solving of a maximization problem through dynamic programming. As part of the optimization course at ENPC. 

*Objective and Implementation*
---
The aim of this project is to maximize the profit of a seller. This profit is given in relations to a stock *x*, a demand *d* and a number of orders *o*.

The Bellman equation is written and the dynamic programming algorithm implemented to compute the stock necessary to maximize the profit. 

The dynamic programming approach is compared to an estimation obtained through a Monte-Carlo Method.
